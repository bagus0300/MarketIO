# laced-pp5
Django-based eCommerce site

# Project Background

- Laced is a fictional eCommerce store selling AI-generated shoes.
- The project was my fifth and final project submitted as part of my Diploma in Full Stack Web Development with Code Institute and aims to combine the skills learned throughout the course from front-end development, UX design, databases testing and full-stack frameworks, APIs and payment services.

# Process

## Design
- Mockups were designed in Figma to explore layout options which would then serve as a guide for development.

## Agile Development

- The development process was carried out using an Agile methodology with a focus on iterative development and continuous improvement.
- The project was managed using a GitHub Project board with user stories and tasks.
- User Stories were sized using T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL) and prioritised based on the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
