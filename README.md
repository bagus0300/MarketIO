# laced-pp5

Django-based eCommerce site

# Project Background

- Laced is a fictional eCommerce store selling AI-generated shoes.
- The project was my fifth and final project submitted as part of my Diploma in Full Stack Web Development with Code Institute and aims to combine the skills learned throughout the course from front-end development, UX design, databases testing and full-stack frameworks, APIs and payment services.

# Process

## Design

- Mockups were designed in Figma to explore layout options which would then serve as a guide for development.

## Agile Development

- The development process was carried out using an Agile methodology with a focus on iterative development and continuous improvement.

  - Read: Users can view all of their saved addresses.
  - Update: Users can edit a saved address.
  - Delete: Users can delete addresses from their profile.
- Admin CRUD functionality exists for all Models and is done from the Django Admin dashboard.

## Authentication & Authorisation

- Users can create an account from the Signup page.
- Users can login from the Login page.
- Authorisation is required to reach certain pages such as Account and Checkout. Requesting these pages while unauthprised will redirect users to the Login page.

## Homepage

- The homepage shows Featured products and Sale products.
- Six Featured/Sale products shown are chosen at random each time the page is loaded.

## Footer

- The footer features social links and a newsletter signup form.

## Shop Page

- The Shop page, accessed from the top navigation, shows all products.

## Product Detail Page

- Each product has a product detail page with the product image, price and description.
- Users can select a product variant, choose a quantity and add to cart.
- Only variants which are in stock are shown on the page.
- When the Add to Cart button is pressed, an AJAX request is sent to a Django view which updates the user's cart.

## Account

The Account page contains the following pages:

### Orders
- The user can view all of their order history.

### Addresses
- CRUD functionality is implemented in this page.

- The Favourites page lets the user review their favourited products to make purchasing at a later date easier.


## Cart
- If a user is not logged in, the cart is associated with the current session ID. It can then be converted to a user's cart if they decide to login, so that they don't lose their items.
- A badge beside the cart shows the quantity of items in the current cart, and is updated via `htmx` when a product is added/removed to/from the cart.


## Checkout
- The checkout page features an address selection widget that uses `htmx` to update the chosen address.
- The payment form utilises Stripe Elements to ensure the secure and PCI compliant processing of payments.

## Roadmap

The site has been delivered in its current state as an MVP and there is still much work to do to improve the UX and functionality of the site, including:

- Product search and filters
- Discount code functionality
- Choice of shipping methods
- Contact page

# Business Model

- Laced is an online eCommerce store where customers can purchase footware online and have it delivered to them.
- All footware designs are AI generated using Leonardo.ai image generation, offering unique and differentiated footware designs.

## Marketing

### SEO

- Keywords such as "performance", "agility" and speed were included in the product descriptions to boost search engine ranking.
- A meta description was added to all products and main pages of the site for SEO purposes.
- There is a significant amount of work involved in renaming all product images and adding alt text to improve SEO, and these items were considered outside of the scope of this project.

### Social

- A fictional Facebook business page was set up for the eCommerce store which offers several advantages:

  - Increased Visibility: Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms globally, with billions of active users. By having a presence on Facebook, the eCommerce store can increase its visibility and reach a wider audience.

  - Customer Engagement: Facebook provides a platform for direct interaction with customers. Users can like, comment, and share posts, allowing for real-time engagement and feedback. This interaction fosters a sense of community around the brand and helps build relationships with customers.

  - Marketing Opportunities: Facebook offers various marketing tools, such as targeted advertising and sponsored posts, that enable the store to reach specific demographics and target audiences. These tools can help drive traffic to the website and increase sales.

  - Brand Building: A Facebook business page allows the store to showcase its brand personality, values, and story. Consistent branding across social media channels helps establish brand identity and recognition.

  - Customer Support: Facebook can serve as a customer support channel, allowing customers to ask questions, seek assistance, and provide feedback. Timely responses to inquiries demonstrate excellent customer service and can help build trust and loyalty.

## Newsletter

- A newletter form is present on the footer of every page, which offers a variety of benefits:

  - Lead Generation: The newsletter form serves as a lead generation tool, allowing visitors to subscribe to receive updates, promotions, and other relevant content from the store. By capturing email addresses, the store can build a valuable database of potential customers.

  - Direct Communication: Newsletters provide a direct line of communication with subscribers. The store can use newsletters to share product announcements, special offers, industry news, and other information directly with customers, without relying on third-party platforms.

  - Customer Retention: Regular newsletters help keep the store top-of-mind for subscribers, increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases. By providing valuable content and exclusive offers, newsletters can help foster customer loyalty and retention.

  - Traffic and Engagement: Newsletters can drive traffic to the website by promoting new products, blog posts, or other content. Additionally, newsletters can encourage engagement by including calls-to-action that prompt subscribers to visit the website or follow the store on social media.

  - Analytics and Insights: Newsletter platforms typically provide analytics tools that allow the store to track open rates, click-through rates, and other metrics. These insights can help optimize future campaigns and improve overall marketing effectiveness


# Bugs

## Resolved

- A bug was identified where an address could be added multiple times by refreshing the page after submitting the address form. This was resolved by adding a redirect on submission.
- During development, when a user deleted their default address, it caused issues in the checkout and profile as no new default address was being set. This was resolved by including logic to set a new default address every time the current default is deleted.
- During testing of the payments integration, it was found that a new address was being added every time a payment/order was processed. This was due to incorrectly configured model inheritance where the `OrderAddress` was inherting from `UserAddress`, which meant every time an `OrderAddress` was created, it was also reflected in the `UserAddress` table. This was corrected by using an abstract `Address` class which both `UserAddress` and `OrderAddress` would inherit from, each now having their own tables in the database.

## Unresolved

- Slow SQL queries are present throughout the site, particularly in the Admin site when browsing models. Attempts to fix this using `prefetch_related` have not been successful and further investigation is required which is planned for future development.
